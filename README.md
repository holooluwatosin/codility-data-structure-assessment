### Explanation of the Solution:

The goal of this solution is to determine the **maximum zigzag length** in a binary tree. A zigzag path is a sequence of nodes where we alternate between going left and right (or vice versa) at each step.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Zigzag Definition**: A zigzag path alternates directions (e.g., left → right → left). If the direction remains the same (e.g., left → left), it's not considered part of a zigzag.
2. **Recursive Traversal**: The solution uses a recursive function to traverse the tree and calculate the maximum zigzag length.

### Approach Taken:

#### 1. **Recursive Function:**
   - The `traverse` function is used to explore the tree. It keeps track of:
     - `node`: The current node being processed.
     - `prevDir`: The direction we came from ('L' for left, 'R' for right, or `null` for the root).
     - `turns`: The number of direction changes (zigzags) so far.
   - If the current node is `null`, we return and stop processing.

#### 2. **Zigzag Calculation:**
   - For each node, we:
     - Move to the left child (`node.l`):
       - If the previous direction was "right" (`prevDir === 'R'`), this counts as a zigzag turn (`turns + 1`).
       - Otherwise, the path continues in the same direction (`turns` remains unchanged).
     - Move to the right child (`node.r`):
       - If the previous direction was "left" (`prevDir === 'L'`), this counts as a zigzag turn (`turns + 1`).
       - Otherwise, the path continues in the same direction (`turns` remains unchanged).

#### 3. **Track Maximum Zigzag Length:**
   - The variable `maxZigzag` keeps track of the longest zigzag path found during the traversal.
   - At each recursive call, `Math.max(maxZigzag, turns)` updates this value.

#### 4. **Base Case (Edge Case):**
   - If the tree (`T`) is empty, the function immediately returns `0` as there are no zigzag paths.

#### 5. **Initiate Traversal:**
   - Start the recursion from the root node (`T`) with `prevDir` as `null` and `turns` as `0`.

### Time and Space Complexity:

#### **Time Complexity:**
- **O(N)**, where `N` is the number of nodes in the tree.
- Each node is visited once during the recursive traversal.

#### **Space Complexity:**
- **O(H)**, where `H` is the height of the tree.
- This accounts for the recursive call stack, which grows to the height of the tree.

### Example Walkthrough:

Consider the following tree:

```
       1
      / \
     2   3
    /     \
   4       5
    \     /
     6   7
```

1. Starting at root (1):
   - Move left to node (2) → No zigzag yet (`turns = 0`).
2. At node (2):
   - Move left to node (4) → No zigzag (`turns = 0`).
   - Move right to node (6) → Zigzag detected (`turns = 1`).
3. Back at root (1):
   - Move right to node (3) → Zigzag detected (`turns = 1`).
4. At node (3):
   - Move right to node (5) → No zigzag (`turns = 1`).
   - Move left to node (7) → Zigzag detected (`turns = 2`).

The longest zigzag in this tree is 2.

### Summary:

- **Approach**: Use a recursive function to traverse the tree while tracking direction changes (zigzags).
- **Strengths**: Efficient (O(N)) and handles edge cases (empty tree).
- **Limitations**: Relies on recursion, which can cause stack overflow for very deep trees. A stack-based iterative solution could be used for optimization.
